# demography

This package implements a simple mechanism for quickly loading demographic data based on post codes. This is currently only implemented for the UK. It is based on data made available by the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS). 

The data was taken from [Geoportal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets).
